<h1>Hobbies!</h1>
<p>There are a few things I can be passionate about.
<ol>
    <li>Video Games!</li>

    <p>I love many video games, most of all being the Legend Of Zelda series pictured above. 
        As long there is a good story, I am hooked. From more recent titles like Ghost of Tshushima,
        to older titles like Dark Cloud that I grew up with. There are worlds and
        stories to explore in every single one. I also like to play MMOs (Massive Multiplayer Online)
        like World of Warcraft and Final Fantasy 14.
    </p>
    <li>Books!</li>

    <p>Much like video games, books have so many worlds and people to
        discover. I like Fantasy and Sci-Fi the most, but will read just about
        anything. My favorite being Brandon Sanderson's The Stormlight Archives.
    </p>
    <li>Music!</li>

    <p>Music has something to it that hits me in no way that other media
        just can't reach. Songs with great lyrics hit, but when that music
        smacks you with feelings as well... Oh man there is nothing like it.
        I have always wished I could play guitar or smash out on the drums.
        David Gorhl and the Foo Fighters are one of the top bands I enjoy, but
        the list is endless on the bands I like. Pop, Punk rock, Alternitive, Heavy Metal,
        and maybe a little bit of rap.
