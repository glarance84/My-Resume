    <p>This is Greg. I am a passionate nerd who loves stories of 
        grand adventures and dream of having adventures of 
        my own. I have been working in networking IT for almost
        5 years now. While I enjoy making sure people can play
        Call of Duty or Fortnite, I want to be a creator.
        whether that is making video games, websites, music, apps, movies,
        YouTube, etc. I want to bring stories to people and touch
        the way I have been touched by these things (Not in a creepy
        way lol)
    </p>
    
    <p>So this is for an Udemy Class that is about Web Development.
        I hope that I can make something of this and want to try my
        best. Thank you for checking out my site!

    <h2>Education</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Graduated from Weatherford High School 2010</li>
        <li>Have taken some classes in Collage:

                <li>Weatherford Collage</li>
                <li>Blinn Collage</li>

    </ul>
    <h2>Work Experience</h2>
    <p>Majority of my work experience has been in customer service.
        I was focused on Hotel work for a short time and thought

        the want to do that any more.
